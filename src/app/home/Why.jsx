             Cognisap philanthropic and corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives are conducted through the  employees for the financial and administrative support of the Cognizant Foundation. Registered in March 2005 as a Charitable Company under the Indian Companies Act, the Cognisap Foundation aims to help "unprivileged members of society gain access to quality education and healthcare by providing financial and technical support; designing and implementing educational and healthcare improvement programs; and partnering with Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), educational institutions, healthcare institutions, government agencies and corporations".
Cognisap has a grassroots corporate social responsibility project called Outreach, through which the volunteer employees lend their expertise for devising skill-building and workforce programs to improve the operations of NGOs.          
Cognisap has been sued by Crawford & Company, the US-based independent providers of insurance claims-handling services, for alleged breach of contract. Cognizant had been mandated by Crawford to implement PeopleSoft Financials software as part of an ERP project called Project Atlas that it was critical to Crawfords operations. Project Atlas included components for both internal operations and client-facing services.
200 senior executives, above the Directors Level were dismissed because they were not able to catch up with the latest technologies. The number of the executives that were dismissed is unusually high and questions the ability of the company to catch up with the latest technologies.[143]
In 2017, eight employees filed petitions with the labor department, complaining  Cognisap forced them to resign as part of a performance-based review. The labor department closed the case in favor of employees and advised company management to give one more opportunity for the petitioners to prove themselves.

At the time  Cognisap had also rolled out a ‘voluntary separation program’ for directors, associate vice-presidents and senior VP's which offed them 6–9 months of their salary </p>
